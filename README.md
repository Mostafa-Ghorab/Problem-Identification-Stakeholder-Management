## DELIVERABLE 2: Root Cause Analysis Questions

### Questions:
1. Why did sales drop in the last month?
2. Why are customers abandoning their carts?
3. Why is user registration mandatory for checkout?
4. Why weren’t these changes tested with users initially?
5. Why was customer convenience not prioritized?

**Root Cause Diagnosis:**  
The key issue lies in a poorly executed checkout redesign that prioritizes data collection over user convenience, resulting in a frustrating shopping experience, cart abandonment, and negative feedback.
